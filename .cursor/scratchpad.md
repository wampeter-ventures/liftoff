# Next.js Conversion Plan for Liftoff Game

## 🎯 **Goal**: Convert vanilla HTML/React app to Next.js without breaking game logic or layouts

## 📋 **Current State Analysis**
- ✅ Vanilla React with browser Babel transpilation
- ✅ Components exported to `window` globals
- ✅ Game logic in inline `<script>` tags
- ✅ External CDN for React/Babel
- ✅ CSS in separate file
- ✅ Drag/drop + click-to-place functionality working
- ✅ Single/multiplayer support working

## 🔄 **Conversion Steps**

### **Phase 1: Setup Next.js Infrastructure** ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Create `package.json` with Next.js dependencies
2. ✅ Create `next.config.js` for configuration
3. ✅ Create `pages/` directory structure
4. ✅ Set up proper npm scripts

### **Phase 2: Component Migration** ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Convert `src/components/*.js` from window exports to ES6 modules
2. ✅ Keep all component logic identical
3. ✅ Change `window.ComponentName = ComponentName` to `export default ComponentName`
4. ✅ Maintain React hooks and state management exactly as-is

### **Phase 3: Game Logic Migration** ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Extract GameLogic from `index.html` inline script to `lib/gameLogic.js`
2. ✅ Keep all placement rules, validation, and victory conditions identical
3. ✅ Export as ES6 module instead of `window.GameLogic`

### **Phase 4: Main App Migration** ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Convert `src/App.js` from window export to Next.js page component
2. ✅ Move HTML structure from `index.html` to `pages/_app.js` and `pages/index.js`
3. ✅ Keep all state management (useState, useEffect) identical
4. ✅ Maintain click-to-place and drag/drop functionality

### **Phase 5: Styling & Assets** ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Move `src/nyt-styles.css` to `styles/globals.css`
2. ✅ Ensure all CSS classes and animations work identically
3. ✅ Keep Font Awesome and Google Fonts integration

### **Phase 6: Manifest & PWA** ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Migrate `manifest.json` to Next.js public folder
2. ✅ Set up proper PWA configuration
3. ✅ Maintain offline capabilities
