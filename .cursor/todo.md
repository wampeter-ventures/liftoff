# Liftoff Game - TODO List

## üéØ High Priority Items

### Bugs
- ~~Fix the single player bug. If 1 player, it should still work. Right now it gets stuck in a dead end after first roll.~~
  - ‚úÖ Fixed: Single player mode now properly advances turns and re-rolls dice for the same player after each turn.
- Clear the game state when you go back to the setup screen. Make sure it really clears.
- When the 5th row is built, we still need room for a 6th row for the 6s (the boosters)

### Mobile/PWA Improvements
- ~~Improve touch interactions (tap to place dice as alternative to drag/drop)~~
  - ‚úÖ Implemented: Click/tap to select dice, then click/tap grid slots or fire zone to place them. Works on both mobile and desktop.
- [ ] Test and fix responsive design on various mobile devices
- [ ] Add haptic feedback for mobile devices, if this is possible as a mobile web app, not a native mobile app


### Game Flow & UX
- [ ] Update the game tutorial with a drawer
- [ ] Add confirmation animations for critical actions (send to fire, place dice)
- [ ] Add sound effects and audio feedback

### Visual Polish
- [ ] Enhance dice rolling animations
- [ ] Add particle effects for fire pile and launch
- [ ] Improve rocket launch animation sequence
- [ ] Add visual indicators for victory tiers
- [ ] Better loading states and transitions


## Things to Organize

- Put instructions on popup drawer, re-initiated with a click on a ? on the top right


- Animate the moment where you remove the excess rocket body rows when you add a six and move on to the launch phase. We want the user to see that those rows get crossed out then fade away and the sixes animate as they slide  up. 

- Add a better launch screen that has Dice rolling and clarity about the fact that you‚Äôre hoping to roll a six rolling one die at a time 



- Change the canvas when you get to phase 2 (first booster placed)
- Change again when you get to phase 3 (complete body, still building boosters)
- Change again when you get to phase 4 (complete body and complete boosters)




- At launch, Animate the rocket moving then the 6s rolling one by one, and if they all sputter out, then the rocket touches back down, but if one is a 6, then the rocket takes off and flies up and off the page.



- Add a toggle that lets you visualize the rocket in picture mode
- Add special features that let you build different rocket ships
