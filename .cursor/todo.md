- Click-to-place implementation may have broken touch events
- Mobile viewport/touch target sizing issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Touch drag events register correctly on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- [ ] Dice can be dragged from roll area to rocket grid using touch
- [ ] Drop zones provide visual feedback during touch drag operations
- [ ] Both click-to-place AND drag-drop work simultaneously without conflict
- [ ] Touch targets are appropriately sized (minimum 44px per iOS guidelines)
- [ ] Tested on iPhone, Android phone, and tablet devices

**Technical Approach:**
- Implement `touchstart`, `touchmove`, `touchend` event handlers
- Add feature detection to use appropriate event types
- Ensure preventDefault() is called to avoid scroll conflicts

### #002 - Game State Persistence and Reset Issues

**Description:** When players navigate back to setup or start a new game, clear the previous game data BUT retain the original/previous player count, player names and dice counts at the setup screen, so that they can replay the game with the same criteria.


**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Game state reset when returning to setup screen
- [ ] All game state variables properly initialized to default values
- [ ] Rocket grid visually clears all dice positions
- [ ] Player configuration arrays reset to original choice (player count, player names and dice count)
- [ ] Fire pile counter returns to 0
- [ ] Current dice roll array emptied
- [ ] Turn tracking reset to player 1
- [ ] Booster lock state reset to false


---

## 🎮 Core Gameplay (P1 - High Priority)

### #003 - Rocket Layout Accommodation for Boosters
**Status:** Visual Bug  
**Impact:** Layout breaks when transitioning to booster phase  
**Description:** When players fill all 5 body rows, there's insufficient visual space allocated for the 6th row where booster dice (6s) must be placed, causing layout overflow and confusion.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Dynamic space allocation based on rocket progression
- [ ] 6th row space reserved and clearly indicated for booster dice
- [ ] Visual distinction between body rows (1-5) and booster row (6)
- [ ] Smooth layout transitions as rocket grows
- [ ] Proper spacing maintains usability on mobile devices
- [ ] Grid remains centered and proportional at all stages

**Technical Approach:**

- Add visual indicators for booster zone
- Consider collapsible/expandable row system

---

### #004 - Failed Launch Consequences and Balance
**Status:** Game Balance Issue  
**Impact:** Game lacks proper risk/reward balance  
**Description:** Currently, failed launches return all dice to the player, making failure inconsequential. This undermines the tension and strategy that should define the booster rolling phase.

**Current vs. Desired Behavior:**
- **Current:** Failed launch → all booster dice returned to player
- **Desired:** Failed launch → one booster die lost to fire pile, rest remain as boosters

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] On failed launch, randomly select one booster die for fire pile
- [ ] Remaining booster dice stay in position for next attempt
- [ ] Turn advances to next player after processing failure
- [ ] Clear messaging explains the consequence to players
- [ ] Fire pile counter increments appropriately
- [ ] Statistics track failed launches separately from successful ones

**Game Design Rationale:**
This change increases strategic tension by making booster accumulation risky. Players must balance between adding more boosters (higher success chance) vs. risking more dice to fire.

---

### #005 - End Game State Detection and Flow
**Status:** Game Flow Bug  
**Impact:** Players get stuck when all dice are exhausted  
**Description:** When all players have zero dice remaining, the game doesn't automatically detect this condition or guide players toward resolution, leading to confusion about how to proceed.

**Scenarios to Handle:**
1. All players out of dice + launchable rocket exists → prompt launch
2. All players out of dice + unlaunchable rocket → auto-fail with message
3. Mixed scenarios with some players having dice

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Automatic detection when all players reach zero dice
- [ ] Check if current rocket configuration allows launch attempt
- [ ] If launchable: show launch prompt with "final attempt" messaging
- [ ] If not launchable: auto-advance to results with "ran out of rocket parts" message
- [ ] Use thematic language ("explosive failure", "mission scrubbed", etc.)
- [ ] Proper statistics tracking for both end-game scenarios
- [ ] Clear visual indication of end-game state

**User Experience Considerations:**
- End-game messaging should feel thematic and satisfying, not punishing
- Players should understand why the game ended
- Smooth transition to results/restart flow

---

### #006 - Remove Arbitrary Rocket Height Restrictions
**Status:** Feature Enhancement  
**Impact:** Artificial limitation reduces strategic depth  
**Description:** Current implementation limits rockets to 5 levels, but the game rules and logic could support unlimited height, providing more strategic options and replayability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Remove hardcoded height limit of 5 rows
- [ ] Create success tier messaging for heights 6-10, 11-20, 21-50, 50+
- [ ] Ensure UI scales appropriately for taller rockets
- [ ] Maintain performance with larger grid sizes
- [ ] Update victory condition calculations for unlimited height
- [ ] Preserve game balance (higher rockets = more risk but better rewards)

**Success Tier Examples:**
- 6-7 rows: "Orbital Mission Success"
- 8-10 rows: "Moon Landing Achievement"  
- 11-15 rows: "Mars Mission Accomplished"
- 16+ rows: "Deep Space Explorer"
