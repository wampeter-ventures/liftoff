# Liftoff Game - Development Roadmap

New things:

- player setup: Remove "Number of Players" dropdown, and just have it be a list of Players, and a + button to add more rows and a delete button to delete a row


- haptics for dice rolling and placing into body and into fire

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues (P0 - Immediate)

### #001 - Mobile Drag and Drop System Failure
**Status:** Critical Bug  
**Impact:** Mobile users cannot play the game at all  
**Description:** The drag and drop functionality that works on desktop completely fails on mobile devices. Touch events are not properly handled, making the primary interaction method unusable.

**Root Cause Analysis Needed:**
- Touch event handlers may be missing or incorrect
- Click-to-place implementation may have broken touch events
- Mobile viewport/touch target sizing issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Touch drag events register correctly on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- [ ] Dice can be dragged from roll area to rocket grid using touch
- [ ] Drop zones provide visual feedback during touch drag operations
- [ ] Both click-to-place AND drag-drop work simultaneously without conflict
- [ ] Touch targets are appropriately sized (minimum 44px per iOS guidelines)
- [ ] Tested on iPhone, Android phone, and tablet devices

**Technical Approach:**
- Implement `touchstart`, `touchmove`, `touchend` event handlers
- Add feature detection to use appropriate event types
- Ensure preventDefault() is called to avoid scroll conflicts

### #002 - Game State Persistence and Reset Issues

**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED  
**Description:** When players navigate back to setup or start a new game, clear the previous game data BUT retain the original/previous player count, player names and dice counts at the setup screen, so that they can replay the game with the same criteria.

**Implementation Summary:**
- Added `originalPlayerSetup` state to track initial player configuration
- Modified `startGame()` to store original setup data
- Created `resetGamePreservingSetup()` function for game resets that maintain player data
- Updated `GameSetup` component to accept and use preserved player configuration
- Modified back button and restart functions to use setup-preserving reset

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Game state reset when returning to setup screen
- [x] All game state variables properly initialized to default values
- [x] Rocket grid visually clears all dice positions
- [x] Player configuration arrays reset to original choice (player count, player names and dice count)
- [x] Fire pile counter returns to 0
- [x] Current dice roll array emptied
- [x] Turn tracking reset to player 1
- [x] Booster lock state reset to false

**Testing Notes:**
- Setup screen now pre-populates with previous player configuration when returning from game
- Going to welcome screen clears preserved setup (fresh start)
- All game state properly resets while preserving original player setup

### #005 - End Game State Detection and Flow
**Status:** Game Flow Bug  
**Impact:** Players get stuck when all dice from all players are exhausted  
**Description:** When all players have zero dice remaining, the game doesn't automatically detect this condition or guide players toward resolution, leading to confusion about how to proceed.

**Scenarios to Handle:**
1. All players out of dice + launchable rocket exists â†’ prompt launch
2. All players out of dice + unlaunchable rocket â†’ auto-fail with message
3. Mixed scenarios with some players having dice

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Automatic detection when all players reach zero dice
- [ ] Check if current rocket configuration allows launch attempt
- [ ] If launchable: show launch prompt with "final attempt" messaging
- [ ] If not launchable: auto-advance to results with "ran out of rocket parts" message
- [ ] Use thematic language ("explosive failure", "mission scrubbed", etc.)
- [ ] Proper statistics tracking for both end-game scenarios
- [ ] Clear visual indication of end-game state

**User Experience Considerations:**
- End-game messaging should feel thematic and satisfying, not punishing
- Players should understand why the game ended
- Smooth transition to results/restart flow

---

### #006 - Remove Arbitrary Rocket Height Restrictions
**Status:** Feature Enhancement  
**Impact:** Artificial limitation reduces strategic depth  
**Description:** Current implementation limits rockets to 5 levels, but the game rules and logic could support unlimited height, providing more strategic options and replayability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Remove hardcoded height limit of 5 rows
- [ ] Create success tier messaging for heights 6-10, 11-20, 21-50, 50+
- [ ] Ensure UI scales appropriately for taller rockets
- [ ] Maintain performance with larger grid sizes
- [ ] Update victory condition calculations for unlimited height
- [ ] Preserve game balance (higher rockets = more risk but better rewards)

**Success Tier Examples:**
- 6-7 rows: "Orbital Mission Success"
- 8-10 rows: "Moon Landing Achievement"  
- 11-15 rows: "Mars Mission Accomplished"
- 16+ rows: "Deep Space Explorer"

### #008 - Enhanced Launch Sequence Animation
**Status:** Polish Enhancement  
**Impact:** Climactic moment lacks drama and clarity  
**Description:** The launch phase should be the most exciting moment of the game, but currently feels flat and lacks clear visual feedback about success/failure.

**Current Issues:**
- All booster dice roll simultaneously (no suspense)
- Success/failure outcome not immediately clear
- No celebration or commiseration animation
- Transition back to game state is abrupt

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Sequential booster dice rolling with timing suspense
- [ ] Rocket movement animation during launch sequence
- [ ] Clear visual indication of success threshold vs. actual roll
- [ ] Success: rocket flies upward off-screen with celebration
- [ ] Failure: rocket returns to pad with explosion/smoke effects
- [ ] Smooth transition back to game state after animation
- [ ] Audio cues synchronized with visual elements (if audio implemented)

**Animation Sequence Design:**
1. Zoom focus to launch pad
2. Roll booster dice one-by-one with sound
3. Running total indicator showing progress toward target
4. Moment of suspense before final outcome
5. Celebration or failure animation
6. Results summary with achievements
7. Return to game or setup

### #009 - Rocket Construction Phase Transitions
**Status:** Visual Feedback Issue  
**Impact:** Players confused about game state changes  
**Description:** When the rocket transitions from body-building phase to booster phase, there's no clear visual feedback about what has changed or what positions are now available/restricted.

**Transition Events:**
- First booster die placed (locks booster row)
- Body rows become inaccessible
- Available positions change dramatically

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Smooth visual transition when booster phase begins
- [ ] Fade out or cross out inaccessible body positions
- [ ] Highlight available booster positions
- [ ] Clear messaging about phase change ("Now building boosters!")
- [ ] Animated indicators showing rule changes
- [ ] Maintain visual clarity of existing dice placements

**Visual Design:**
- Use color coding: green for available, red for blocked, gray for filled
- Add subtle animations to draw attention to newly available areas
- Consider adding a "phase indicator" UI element

---

### #010 - Launch Results and Victory Communication
**Status:** Feedback Enhancement  
**Impact:** Players don't understand achievement levels  
**Description:** The victory screen doesn't clearly communicate how well players performed relative to possible outcomes, diminishing the satisfaction of success.

**Current Issues:**
- No clear indication of achievement level (basic vs. excellent)
- Duplicate display bug showing 6s in body rows
- Static results don't convey journey/progression
- Lack of context about difficulty of achievement

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Animated progression showing rocket journey to destination
- [ ] Clear achievement level indication (Bronze/Silver/Gold or similar)
- [ ] Fix duplicate 6s display bug in body row visualization
- [ ] Destination-based messaging (orbit, moon, Mars, deep space)
- [ ] Performance summary: rows completed, total dice used, attempts
- [ ] Scaled celebration animation based on achievement level
- [ ] Social sharing ready format for results

**Achievement Tiers:**
- Level 1: Low Earth Orbit (minimal success)
- Level 2: Lunar Mission (solid achievement)  
- Level 3: Interplanetary Mission (excellent execution)
- Level 4+: Deep Space Explorer (exceptional performance)
