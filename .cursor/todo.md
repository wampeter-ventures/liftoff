# Liftoff Game - Development Roadmap

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues (P0 - Immediate)

### #001 - Mobile Drag and Drop System Failure
**Status:** Critical Bug  
**Impact:** Mobile users cannot play the game at all  
**Description:** The drag and drop functionality that works on desktop completely fails on mobile devices. Touch events are not properly handled, making the primary interaction method unusable.

**Root Cause Analysis Needed:**
- Touch event handlers may be missing or incorrect
- Click-to-place implementation may have broken touch events
- Mobile viewport/touch target sizing issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Touch drag events register correctly on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- [ ] Dice can be dragged from roll area to rocket grid using touch
- [ ] Drop zones provide visual feedback during touch drag operations
- [ ] Both click-to-place AND drag-drop work simultaneously without conflict
- [ ] Touch targets are appropriately sized (minimum 44px per iOS guidelines)
- [ ] Tested on iPhone, Android phone, and tablet devices

**Technical Approach:**
- WE've tried a bunch of approaches and none are working!!!!

### #006 - Remove Arbitrary Rocket Height Restrictions
**Status:** Feature Enhancement  
**Impact:** Artificial limitation reduces strategic depth  
**Description:** Current implementation limits rockets to 5 levels, but the game rules and logic could support unlimited height, providing more strategic options and replayability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Remove hardcoded height limit of 5 rows
- [ ] Create success tier messaging for heights 6-10, 11-20, 21-50, 50+
- [ ] Ensure UI scales appropriately for taller rockets
- [ ] Maintain performance with larger grid sizes
- [ ] Update victory condition calculations for unlimited height
- [ ] Preserve game balance (higher rockets = more risk but better rewards)

**Success Tier Examples:**
- 6-7 rows: "Orbital Mission Success"
- 8-10 rows: "Moon Landing Achievement"  
- 11-15 rows: "Mars Mission Accomplished"
- 16+ rows: "Deep Space Explorer"

## ðŸŽµ Polish and Engagement (P3-P4)

### #016 - Audio Design System Implementation
**Status:** Experience Enhancement  
**Impact:** Missing auditory feedback reduces engagement  
**Description:** No audio feedback exists for game actions, missing an opportunity to enhance game feel and accessibility.

**Sound Design Requirements:**
- Dice rolling sound (satisfying physics-based audio)
- Placement confirmation (positive reinforcement)
- Invalid move feedback (gentle correction)
- Launch sequence audio (building tension)
- Success/failure audio (emotional payoff)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Comprehensive sound effect library with consistent style
- [ ] Dice rolling physics-based audio with multiple variations
- [ ] Placement confirmation sounds with pitch variation
- [ ] Launch sequence audio building to climax
- [ ] Victory/failure audio appropriate to outcome level
- [ ] Volume controls and mute toggle
- [ ] Audio accessibility features (visual alternatives)
- [ ] Performance optimization (audio loading, caching)

**Technical Considerations:**
- Web Audio API vs. HTML5 audio elements
- Mobile audio playback restrictions
- Battery impact optimization
- Accessibility alternatives for deaf/hard-of-hearing users

## ðŸ“Š Analytics and Social Features (P3-P4)

### #019 - Player Statistics and Achievement System
**Status:** Engagement Feature  
**Impact:** No long-term progression or performance tracking  
**Description:** Players have no way to track improvement, compare performances, or work toward long-term goals, limiting replayability.

**Statistics to Track:**
- Games played, win rate, average rocket height
- Best single launch distance
- Total dice placed, success rate by position
- Streak tracking (consecutive successes)
- Time-based statistics (daily, weekly, monthly)

**Achievement Categories:**
- **Builder**: Row completion achievements
- **Booster**: Launch success achievements  
- **Explorer**: Distance/height achievements
- **Strategist**: Efficiency and optimization achievements
- **Social**: Multiplayer and sharing achievements

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Local storage system for persistent statistics
- [ ] Wordle-style daily statistics dashboard
- [ ] Achievement system with unlockable rewards (dice themes, etc.)
- [ ] Performance trends and improvement tracking
- [ ] Privacy-conscious implementation (local storage only)
- [ ] Export/import functionality for data portability
- [ ] Achievement sharing integration

---

### #020 - Social Sharing and Competition
**Status:** Viral Growth Feature  
**Impact:** Limited viral potential and community building  
**Description:** No sharing mechanisms exist to help players communicate their achievements or engage with others around the game.

**Sharing Features:**
- Wordle-style emoji result sharing
- Screenshot generation of completed rockets
- Challenge creation (specific starting conditions)
- Performance leaderboards (opt-in)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] One-click sharing of game results with emoji summary
- [ ] Automated screenshot generation of completed rockets
- [ ] Daily challenge system with shared starting conditions
- [ ] Local leaderboard system (friends-based)
- [ ] Global leaderboard with privacy controls
- [ ] Challenge links that recreate specific game conditions
- [ ] Social media platform integration (Twitter, Facebook, Discord)

**Privacy Considerations:**
- All sharing opt-in only
- No personal data collection
- Local-first approach with optional sharing
- Clear privacy policy and controls

### #022 - Rocket Variety and Customization System
**Status:** Replayability Enhancement  
**Impact:** All rockets currently function identically  
**Description:** Different rocket types with unique characteristics could significantly enhance replayability and player expression.

**Rocket Types Concepts:**
- **Cargo Rocket**: Larger capacity, requires more boosters
- **Exploration Rocket**: Special victory conditions, science bonuses
- **Military Rocket**: Faster build requirements, different risk profile
- **Tourist Rocket**: Passenger safety requirements, comfort metrics

**Customization Elements:**
- Visual themes and color schemes
- Component styling options
- Player emblems or team markings
- Rocket naming and history tracking

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Design balanced rocket types with distinct gameplay
- [ ] Unique victory conditions and build requirements per type
- [ ] Visual customization system with unlockable options
- [ ] Rocket selection phase integration
- [ ] Achievement system tied to rocket variety mastery
- [ ] Maintain game balance across all rocket types
