# Liftoff Game - TODO List

## üéØ High Priority Items

### Bugs
- ~~Fix the single player bug. If 1 player, it should still work. Right now it gets stuck in a dead end after first roll.~~
  - ‚úÖ Fixed: Single player mode now properly advances turns and re-rolls dice for the same player after each turn.
- Clear the game state when you go back to the setup screen. Make sure it really clears.
- When the 5th row is built, we still need room for a 6th row for the 6s (the boosters)

### Mobile/PWA Improvements
- ~~Improve touch interactions (tap to place dice as alternative to drag/drop)~~
  - ‚úÖ Implemented: Click/tap to select dice, then click/tap grid slots or fire zone to place them. Works on both mobile and desktop.
- [ ] Test and fix responsive design on various mobile devices
- [ ] Add haptic feedback for mobile devices, if this is possible as a mobile web app, not a native mobile app


### Game Flow & UX
- [ ] Update the game tutorial with a drawer
- [ ] Add confirmation animations for critical actions (send to fire, place dice)
- [ ] Add sound effects and audio feedback

### Visual Polish
- [ ] Enhance dice rolling animations
- [ ] Add particle effects for fire pile and launch
- [ ] Improve rocket launch animation sequence
- [ ] Add visual indicators for victory tiers
- [ ] Better loading states and transitions
