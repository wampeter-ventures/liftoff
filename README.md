# 🚀 Liftoff

*A dice game for daring crews: Build it. Boost it. Blast off—or blow up together.*

**Liftoff** is a fast, collaborative dice game where you and your friends (or your bravest solo self) race to assemble a rocket and launch it into space. Every roll can bring you closer to glory—or fiery disaster. Will you reach the stars or fizzle out in a ball of smoke?

---

## 🎯 What’s the Goal?

Work together to build a rocket, attach boosters, and yell “Lift-Off!”—all before your mistakes (the dreaded Fire Pile) catch up with you.

---

## 🎲 How to Play

1. **Take Turns Rolling:**  
   On your turn, roll your dice.

2. **Build Your Rocket:**  
   Place **at least one** die each turn into the rocket. The catch? Each slot only accepts a specific number (e.g., a [3] slot needs a 3). Dice must connect to the rocket—no floating parts!

3. **Booster Time:**  
   Place a 6 to start the Boosters. Once you start adding Boosters, your rocket’s height is set!

4. **Uh-oh! The Fire Pile:**  
   If you can’t place a die, you *must* add one die to the Fire Pile. Five dice in Fire and your ship explodes!

5. **Launch or Lose:**  
   Once your rocket is built (with at least one Booster), anyone can call “Lift-Off!”  
   Grab all Booster dice and roll:  
   - If *any* Booster shows a 6: **SUCCESS! Your rocket launches.**  
   - If not: one Booster burns up (to Fire Pile), and the others are reset. Try again—if you can!

## 🌕 Victory Destinations

The farther you build, the farther you fly.  
- Small rocket? Maybe you’ll hit the Moon.  
- Massive rocket? Could be Mars, Jupiter, or beyond.  
- Too many mistakes? **KABOOM!** (That’s a loss.)

---

## 😱 What Makes Liftoff Special?

- **Fast, social, and just a bit chaotic**—every decision matters, and every roll is a thrill.
- **Pure teamwork:** You win or lose together.
- **Instant drama:** The Fire Pile can end your mission at any moment.

---

## 🧑‍🚀 Who’s It For?

Families, friends, classrooms, clubs, and anyone who loves dice, space, and a bit of shouting.

---

## 📖 TL;DR Rules

- **ROLL** your dice.
- **PLACE** at least one body part or rocket booster.
- **CAN’T PLACE?** One die to Fire Pile.
- **FIVE IN FIRE?** Boom, you lose!
- **READY TO LAUNCH?** Roll your Boosters—if any 6s, you win!
